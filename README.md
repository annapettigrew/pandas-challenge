This dataset included a list of all the schools in a given district. After evaluating the raw data, I broke it down into different informational tables.

Starting with an overall district summary of:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Next, I broke it down into a table that showed data per school, grouped by the school name:
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

To go into a deeper dive, I sorted the schools by best and worst performing bassed on overall passing rate. The overall passing rate included the students who passed BOTH Reading and Msth.

To finish off this data set. I then grouped the schools by "Size" "Type" and "Spending" to evaluate if any of these factors effected the overall passing rate. Or individual Reading and Math passing rate.
